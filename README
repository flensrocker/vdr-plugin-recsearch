Description:
Search through your recordings and find the one you are looking for... :)

Files in recsearch's config directory
-------------------------------------

searches.conf:
 Contains all search templates you saved with the red button.

last.conf:
 Contains your last executed search, regardless if it's in your searches.conf
 or not.

Navigation
----------

If there are no stored search templates the edit page is opened, see "Edit
search template". Add as many templates to your searches.conf as you like.

If there are already some templates available, these are shown ordered by
their categories. The tilde "~" is used as a delimiter for submenus.

OK:
 Will open the category or execute the selected search.

Red button:
 If the focus is on a search template it can be edited.

Green button:
 A new search template can be added.

Yellow button:
 If the focus is on a search template it can be deleted.

Edit search template
--------------------

name:
 The name is just a name and will only be used for displaying the search
 template in the OSD. If emtpy, a generic name containing the parameters
 is shown. It is not used by the filter.

search term:
 Enter one or more search terms splitted with '|' (pipe).
 Title, short text and description of the recordings will be searched,
 case will be ignored.
 If the term starts with "t:" only the title will be scanned, with "s:"
 only the short text and with "d:" only the description.

status:
 Restrict the results to only new or edited recordings.

younger than days:
 Show only recordings that are recorded in the last given days.

hot key:
 Bind the search template to a hot key between 1 and 9. You can load and
 execute this search just with pressing the hot key in recsearch's menu.
 And it's useful in your keymacros.conf, e.g. "User0 @recsearch 1"
 You must keep track of your used hot keys on your own. If you assign the
 same hot key to multiple templates the "first" one will be loaded (whatever
 the "first" one is...).

category:
 Put this search template into a category to organize your saved templates
 (see red and blue button). The tilde "~" can be used to divide the categories
 into "folders".

Red button:
 Store the shown search template to your searches.conf.

Green button/OK:
 Start the search and display the results.

Yellow button:
 Delete the shown search template. If it's in your searches.conf, it will be
 deleted from that file but the fields are not cleared (you can add it again
 with the red button). If it's not part of your searches.conf all fields are
 cleared (if you press yellow twice you really get rid off the template).

Blue button:
 Load a search template from your searches.conf.
 If the focus is on the category field you can select one from the available
 categories.

Syntax of searches.conf
-----------------------

Each line contains a search template.
Comments or empty lines are not allowed.
Each search template is a list of key-value pairs separated with a comma.
A key is separated with an '=' from its value.
A key must not contain an '='.
Values can't contain line breaks.
Commas and backslashes in a value must be escaped with a backslash.

Valid keys so far (look at cSearchParameter::ToString):
name, category, term, status, youngerthandays, hotkey
